In this folder there are two files, as well as an Eclipse java project.

> hw6-eclipse folder is the Eclipse java project, and contains two classes
>> HW6Final.java should be run first. It sets up all the tables, and populates them from the files found in the project folder
>> RunQueries.java should be run afterwards. It runs the query, and requires user input to complete.

> Reidy_Code is a Word document of all the code found in the eclipse Eclipse Project. 
>>The first part is the code to set up the database, and the second part runs the query.

> Reidy_Output.pdf is a PDF of all the outputs from setting up the database, the query output, as well as the query analysis.
